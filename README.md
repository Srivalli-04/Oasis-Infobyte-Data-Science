## 🚗 1. Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

### 🔍 Objective
To predict the **selling price of a car** based on various features such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission type, and owner.

### 🧠 Techniques & Libraries Used
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor
- **Steps:**
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection  
  - Model training and evaluation (R² Score, MAE)  
  - Visualizing feature correlations  

### 📈 Outcome
Achieved a high prediction accuracy (R² ≈ 0.96) showing strong correlation between actual and predicted prices.
